			<h2>Physiology</h2>
			<p>As the alpha-male of the pack, the Blangonga is twice as large as the average <a href="http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Blango" target="_blank">Blango</a> with a much more aggressive temperament. Its strong, muscled limbs allow it to run and leap at a startling speed, and its powerful roar can catch hunters unaware without adequate hearing protection.</p>
			<h2>Abilities</h2>
			<p>By calling out to its pack, the Blangonga can summon Blangos to fight beside it in battle. Its deadly speed can bewilder the novice hunter, as they can perform a dive that can send them rolling into their foes and deal out massive damage. Blangongas can break ice at their feet and hurl it at hunters to inflict a Snowman status, or break it into ice shrapnel that can send foes flying.</p>
			<h2>Behavior</h2>
			<p>Blangongas are incredibly aggressive creatures. They will ruthlessly attack hunters and prey, yet shy away from anything larger than themselves.</p>
			<h2>Habitat</h2>
			<p>Blangonga live almost exclusively in the <a href="http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Snowy_Mountains" target="_blank">Snowy Mountains</a>. Their thick coat keeps them warm and serves as the perfect camouflage.</p>
