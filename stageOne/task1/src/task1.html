			<h2>Physiology</h2>
			<p>As the alpha-male of the pack, the Blangonga is twice as large as the average <a href="http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Blango" target="_blank">Blango</a> with a much more aggressive temperament. Its strong, muscled limbs allow it to run and leap at a startling speed, and its powerful roar can catch hunters unaware without adequate hearing protection.</p>
			<h2>Abilities</h2>
			<p>By calling out to its pack, the Blangonga can summon Blangos to fight beside it in battle. Its deadly speed can bewilder the novice hunter, as they can perform a dive that can send them rolling into their foes and deal out massive damage. Blangongas can break ice at their feet and hurl it at hunters to inflict a Snowman status, or break it into ice shrapnel that can send foes flying.</p>
			<h2>Behavior</h2>
			<p>Blangongas are incredibly aggressive creatures. They will ruthlessly attack hunters and prey, yet shy away from anything larger than themselves.</p>
			<h2>Habitat</h2>
			<p>Blangonga live almost exclusively in the <a href="http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Snowy_Mountains" target="_blank">Snowy Mountains</a>. Their thick coat keeps them warm and serves as the perfect camouflage.</p>

			<img src="../res/MH4-Tigrex_Render_001.png" title="Tigrex">
			<h2>Physiology</h2>
			<p>Tigrex is a large, quadrupedal wyvern characterized by its massive head and jaws, powerful limbs and striking yellow/blue striped colouration. The top of its head is tipped with a pair of horn-like ears, and its segmented tail ends with a spiny protrusion.</p>
			<h2>Abilities</h2>
			<p>As a quadrupedal wyvern, its wings have evolved into forelegs, which allows it to run at very fast speeds. Though it possesses a pair of adequately-developed wings, it is rarely seen flying in a traditional sense. It is in fact more prone to gliding from location to location. It has a powerful set of lungs which gives it the ability to produce extremely loud, concussive roars which can physically damage nearby objects. Unlike many other monsters, Tigrex does not wield any elements. Rather, it relies on its sheer brute strength to bring down opponents.</p>
			<h2>Behavior</h2>
			<p>When idle, Tigrex will assume a bipedal gait, standing only upon its hind legs while holding its forelimbs at its side. When threatened or engaging prey, however, it will stand upon all fours and ready itself for combat. It will usually attempt to intimidate would-be attackers with an ear-splitting roar. If combat becomes intense enough, it will flush blood to its forelimbs, face, and eyes, in order to give its skin a bright-red glow as an effort to further intimidate attackers.</p>
			<h2>Habitat</h2>
			<p>The Tigrex can be found in many different environments. Like many wyverns, it will travel far and wide in search of prey.</p>
